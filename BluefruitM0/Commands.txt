Commands are sent to the board via the UART function in the Bluefruit LE application.
They are sent without the quotation marks and are always one letter and capitalized.
New commands will be implemented over time.

Command "T"
  This is the test command. If successful, the line "Comms Test Successful" will appear. This should be sent first before data transfer begins.
  
Command "Q"
  This is the quit command. It will print a message that says "Stopping sensors and closing files...", then it will stop data collection  and close any open files, then it will print the message "Files closed. Ready for next command."
  
Command "V"
  This is the voltage check command. It will query the board for the battery voltage and will print it to your phone. At a full charge,   the voltage may be around 4.2v. Typical is 3.7v. At 3.2v, the protection circuit on the battery will kick in and the device will shut down. This may result in the last sample taken being lost. Between 3.3V and 3.5V a charge reminder is displayed in the serial monitor. If battery voltage drops below 3.3V, a more immediate reminder is sent.
	
Command "S"
  This is the send command. If successful, it will stream Depth,Temperature to your phone. It will only send data collected since you turned it on. If you want to look at previous data, you still need to open the sensor and pull the SD card.

Command "P"
  This is the plot command. It is the exact same as the send command, but has a 20 second delay to allow the user to switch to the     	   plotter function of the Bluefruit app.
  
Command "I"
  This is the information command. It will display the Device ID that you set in the Arduino sketch, the first recorded pressure reading, and the first recorded temperature reading. If turned on above water, these could be considered values for atmospheric pressure and air temperature.
